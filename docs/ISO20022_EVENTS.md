# ISO 20022 Event Integration for JINBI Bonds

## Overview

This document specifies how JINBI smart contract events map to ISO 20022 financial messaging standards for institutional integration and regulatory reporting.

## Core Event Mappings

### Securities Transfer Events

#### TransferByPartition Event
```solidity
event TransferByPartition(
    bytes32 indexed partition,
    address indexed from,
    address indexed to,
    uint256 value,
    bytes data
);
```

**ISO 20022 Mapping**: sese.023.001.07 (SecuritiesSettlementTransactionInstruction)

### Corporate Actions Events

#### CouponPaid Event
```solidity
event CouponPaid(uint256 indexed cycleId, uint256 totalPaid);
```

**ISO 20022 Mapping**: seev.031.001.03 (CorporateActionNotification)

### Compliance Events

#### FlagsSet Event
```solidity
event FlagsSet(address indexed who, Flags flags);
```

**ISO 20022 Mapping**: reda.004.001.05 (PartyAuditTrailSearchCriteria)

## Payment Processing

### DvP Settlement Integration

#### Settled Event
```solidity
event Settled(uint256 id);
```

**ISO 20022 Mapping**: pacs.009.001.08 (FinancialInstitutionCreditTransfer)

## Real-time Event Streaming

### Message Queue Integration

```yaml
# Apache Kafka topic configuration
topics:
  - name: "iso20022.securities.transfer"
    partitions: 10
    replication: 3
    retention: "7d"
  
  - name: "iso20022.corporate.actions"
    partitions: 5
    replication: 3
    retention: "30d"
```
